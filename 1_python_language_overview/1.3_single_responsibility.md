# A class that has multiple responsibilities

### Bad example
```python
class orderReporter:
    def import_orders(self):
        """ Loads orders from a source to be processed """
    
    def export_report(self):
        """ Exports the orders to a downloadable file """
    
    def display_report(self):
        """ Display the report on screen """
    
```

### Good example
The responsibilities are now distributed 
```python
class orderReporter:
    def display(self):
        """ Display the report on screen """
    
```

```python
class orderExporter:
    def process(self):
        """ Processes the export """
    
```

```python
class orderImporter:
    def process(self):
        """ Processes the import """
    
```
